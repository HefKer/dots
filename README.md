# qutebrowser

A keyboard-focused browser with vim bindings. Although it doesn't have extensions, it is highly customizable through its config file. I'm still messing with it but the sessions are really powerful, essentially letting you create, load, and delete workspaces on the fly.

Will share some screenshots once I'm done configuring it.
